Problem 1:
You are in charge of designing software for a bank, to be used for managing customers' accounts.
You first must create a class that represents an individual bank account. 
What data should your class store? 
What operations should you class offer? Think about what people do with bank accounts.
Now, implement the class in Java with the behavior you outlined above. 
Define fields for each of the pieces of data you decided to store.
Define and implement methods for each of the operations you decided to have your class offer.
Think of sequences of operations that would be good to try to test your methods. Justify your choices. 
Can you think of a sequence of operations that may cause problems with a bank account? In essence, how can we break a bank account?
In another file, create a simple test drive class that creates an instance of your bank account class,
executes the sequences you came up with in part 3, and display the results.

/*
Problem 2:
Implement an Elevator class.
The elevator has a fixed number of floors, given as a constructor argument.
The Elevator has a maximum capacity (weight), and should keep track of its current floor.
Add methods to: go up or down by one floor, and add or remove a passenger (with passenger's weight as a parameter).
*/

/*
Problem 3:
Let's code a String class called MyString using array of character. 
The list of methods you can implemented by MyString are: 
length(); return the length of MyString
toString(); return the data as a normal String
toArray(); return the data as an array
equals(MyString s); returns a boolean value representing if s is equal to the data stored
replace(int x,char a) replace index x with the character
replace(char a,char b) all appearance of character a with character b
print(); print the data;
