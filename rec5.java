        Problem: Matrix 1’s and 0’s
        Write a program which takes a 2D array(this 2D array should be randomly filled with 1s and 0s), and prints:
        How many 1's are in the 2D 
        array.
        How many 0's are in the 2D
        array.
        Sample 2D array:
        {1,0,1,0},
        {1,1,0,1},
        {1,0,0,1},
        {0,0,1,0}
        Output Example:
        $ javac OneZeroArray.java
        $ java OneZeroArray
        There were 8 ones and 8 zeroes.

        Problem: Nth Column of Matrix
        Write a program which takes a 2D integer array, arr, and an integer, n, and creates an array containing the nth column of arr.
        You may assume that the matrix has the same number of rows in each column, and that n is a valid column index.
        Sample 2D array:
        {1,0,1,0},
        {1,1,0,1},
        {1,0,0,1}
