    Problem 1:
    A Palindrome is defined as a string that is the same both forwards and backwards. For example, "bob" and "otto" are both palindromes, while “hello” is not.
    Write a method that takes in a string and returns true if the string is a palindrome, false otherwise.
    Modify this method so that the detection is not case sensitive. For example, "Bob" and "OtTo" should now return true.
    Modify this method so that the detection ignores spaces. For example "nolemon,no melon" should now return true.

    s.charAt(i)

    /*
    Problem 2:
    Write a recursive method, isPalindrome, which takes a String as a parameter, and returns true if the String is a palindrome.
    For the purposes of this method, you may assume Strings with a length of 0 or 1 are palindromes.

    Problem 3:
    An anagram is a rearrangement of the letters of a word to form a new word. For example, an anagram of "listen" is "silent".
    Write a method, anagram, that takes a String as input, and returns true if it is an anagram.

    Problem 4:
    Assume that we have a string consisting only of letters. We want to find the longest subsequence where a single letter repeats.
    For example, in the string “abaabacccaabbbba”, the longest repeating subsequence is the four b's near the end.
    Write a method, subseq, to find the longest repeating subsequence of a String and return it.
